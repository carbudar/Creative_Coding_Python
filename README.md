Game UI


### What I Added:
1. Background image,
2. Points and missed enemy counter,
3. Levels - after 10 points, the game goes faster
4. Color overlays - Red to indicate missed enemy, and green to indicate level up
5. Sound effects - (shooting  bullets, enemy shot, enemy goes out of bound, level up)
